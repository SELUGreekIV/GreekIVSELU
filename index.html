    <h2>About Us</h2>
    <p>
      Greek InterVarsity is a Christian ministry dedicated to reaching fraternity and sorority members with the hope of Jesus. Our vision is simple: every Greek is one friend away from Jesus.
    </p>
    <p>
      We believe that faith and Greek life can thrive together. Through small group Bible studies, mentorship, leadership development, and campus events, we create spaces where students can grow spiritually while fully engaging in their Greek community.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whether you are curious about faith, seeking a deeper relationship with God, or looking for a supportive community, Greek InterVarsity is a place to belong. Together, we pursue Jesus and work to bring His love and transformation into every chapter, house, and campus.
